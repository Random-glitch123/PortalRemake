# Portal Game Debug Keybinds
# This file lists all debug keybinds added during development
# These should be removed or disabled before final release

## Debug Movement & Level Controls
N - Advance to next level (works even if level is not complete)
C - Force mark current level as complete (debug only)
O - Force open all doors in the current level (debug only)
R - Reset current level

## Graphics & Performance Controls
L - Toggle enhanced lighting
T - Toggle tessellation
+ / = - Increase tessellation level
- - Decrease tessellation level
F11 - Toggle fullscreen mode
P - Print performance report

## Debug Information
- Wall collision detection now prints debug information when collisions occur
- Door collision detection now prints debug information when collisions occur
- Portal clipping planes now print debug information when set up

## Debug Code Locations
1. handle_events() method - Added debug key 'C' to force level completion
2. check_collision() methods - Added debug print statements
3. Portal rendering code - Added debug print statements for clipping planes
4. next_level() method - Added debug print statements

## How to Remove Debug Features
1. Remove the 'C' key handling in handle_events()
2. Remove debug print statements from collision detection methods
3. Remove debug print statements from portal rendering code
4. Consider making 'N' key only work when level is actually complete
5. Consider removing performance report key or making it a hidden feature

## Notes
These debug features were added to help diagnose and fix issues with:
- Wall clipping
- Portal rendering
- Level transitions

Once these issues are fully resolved in testing, the debug features can be safely removed.
