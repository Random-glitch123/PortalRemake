# Texture Files for Portal Remake

To run the game with proper textures, you'll need to download or create the following texture files and place them in this directory:

## Required Texture Files

1. `wall_concrete.png` - For walls (256x256 recommended)
2. `floor_concrete.png` - For floors (256x256 recommended)
3. `ceiling_tile.png` - For ceilings (256x256 recommended)
4. `portal_blue_rim.png` - For blue portal edges (256x256 recommended)
5. `portal_orange_rim.png` - For orange portal edges (256x256 recommended)

## Where to Find Textures

You can find free textures at:
1. [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/)
2. [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets)
3. [Texture Haven](https://texturehaven.com/)

## Creating Your Own Textures

You can also create your own textures using any image editing software:
1. Use power-of-two dimensions (128x128, 256x256, 512x512)
2. Save in PNG format for transparency support
3. For portal textures, use a circular design with transparency

## Default Behavior

If texture files are missing, the game will automatically generate simple checkerboard patterns as placeholders, so the game will still run without these files.
